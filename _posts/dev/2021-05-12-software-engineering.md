## [Tech interviews are stupid](https://gomakethings.com/tech-interviews-are-stupid/)
Coding is solving problems. A big part of that is looking stuff up.

Like, seriously, the most important skill a developer can have it knowing how to research solutions to problems. Specifically…

- Breaking problems into parts
- Identifying what to search for
- Knowing how to sort good info from junk

A better tech interview process might involve presenting a candidate with a problem and then letting them actually Google stuff. Hell, don’t just let them—encourage them!
