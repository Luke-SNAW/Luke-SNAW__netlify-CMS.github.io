## ðŸŒ  cordova iOS CORS
> https://breautek.com/2020/07/14/enabling-cors/

With `WKWebView`, `CORS` is enabled and enforced. This means that if you make a XHR request, the server must respond in a CORS-compliant way.

In the nutshell, CORS allows you to grant or restrict access to your backend APIs. On every XHR request, an Origin http header is added. The Origin header is always the domain of the executing script.

Starting with `cordova-ios@6`, where the WKWebView is built into the core, you can specify a custom URL scheme (e.g. app://localhost). In these cases, the Origin will be your chosen URL scheme.

So how do implement the protocol? This depends on your tech stack on your server. But most simply your server should respond to every request with the following response headers:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods
