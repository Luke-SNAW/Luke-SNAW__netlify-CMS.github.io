The only way to truly pause an animation in CSS is to use the animation-play-state property with a paused value.
```css
.paused {
  animation-play-state: paused;

## üåü [Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite](https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)

The [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website) page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:

"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"

"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."

"[This is] bad design"

Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.

SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().

## [Faster JavaScript calls](https://v8.dev/blog/adaptor-frame)

JavaScript allows calling a function with a different number of arguments than the expected number of parameters, i.e., one can pass fewer or more arguments than the declared formal parameters. The former case is called under-application and the latter is called over-application.

In the under-application case, the remaining parameters get assigned the undefined value. In the over-application case, the remaining arguments can be accessed by using the rest parameter and the arguments property, or they are simply superfluous and they can be ignored. Many Web/Node.js frameworks nowadays use this JS feature to accept optional parameters and create a more flexible API.

Until recently, V8 had a special machinery to deal with arguments size mismatch: the arguments adaptor frame. Unfortunately, argument adaption comes at a performance cost, but is commonly needed in modern front-end and middleware frameworks. It turns out that, with a clever trick, we can remove this extra frame, simplify the V8 codebase and get rid of almost the entire overhead.

## [The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSocket](https://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-web-software-is-html-over-websockets/)

from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26265999

> The problem is that stateful connections suck and create artificial complexity when you don‚Äôt need them. Instead of managing the state of your app you‚Äôre now managing the state of your app and a connection to a remote server. HTTP is a stateless protocol on top of a stateful socket connection. It wasn‚Äôt designed this way by accident.

> I‚Äôm all for new engineers building SPAs creating exciting new libraries, but HTML-over-websocket has been rehashed at least three times over my professional career so far and it‚Äôs not even that long.

> Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî websockets have their use cases. Multiplayer online experiences pretty much require them. It‚Äôs just that HTTP isn‚Äôt fundamentally broken, and by engineering HTML over websockets you‚Äôll almost universally find yourself building protocols to abstract the state away... re-engineering HTTP in the process.

another from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26265999

> I have thoughts, and I agree but also disagree a bit.
We are in the dark-ages with respect to streaming sockets, and I am the architect of one of the worlds largest WebSocket and streaming services.

> First off, unseating the operational benefits provided by request response is a huge challenge. It's possible, and I've done it. One of these days, my co-authors and I will present an OSDI paper with the broad strokes. It's very easy to list a lot of the challenges with scaling WebSocket, but each of them can be solved.

> I believe we will have a nicer world with QUIC --> Http/3 and the up and coming WebTransport discussion. SADLY, that will result in a decade long "caniuse" issue, so we should expect to see WebTransport polyfills to arrive...

> Second, HTML over WebSockets is nice, but what is better is reactive data binding over the socket. Let the browser maintain a DOM tree that templates over a JSON object, then reactive-ly update and it's an amazing experience. You have minimal data transfer, and minimal rendering updates. There is a great deal of power in having your UI be a stateless function over a giant JSON object.

> Finally, the big challenge is dealing with the server state in a meaningful way. The exceptionally nice property of using request response for everything is the shared-nothing stateless nature of the web server. It's exceptionally forgiving in both operational and developer issues.

> It's very easy to fuck up the implicit state tied to the connection, and this requires discipline to get right. It's very easy to ship unreliable software that then has issues based on the connection.

> Now, I'm a HUGE believer in that we need to use streams for everything, but it requires a mind shift. The key thing to tackle is dealing with the server side state, and this is where I have my shitty idea of a programming language for board games. In essence, I am building a DIY database such that people connect directly to the database and get that sweet giant JSON object along with a stream of updates.

> The DIY part is related to the fact that I invented a programming language to transact on the JSON object such that you get all the benefits of durability with the mental model of working within a single machine.
