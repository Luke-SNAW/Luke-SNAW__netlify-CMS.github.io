## üåü [Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite](https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)

The [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website) page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:

"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"

"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."

"[This is] bad design"

Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.

SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().
