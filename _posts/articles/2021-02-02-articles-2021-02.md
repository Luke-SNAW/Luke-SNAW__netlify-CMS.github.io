The only way to truly pause an animation in CSS is to use the animation-play-state property with a paused value.
```css
.paused {
  animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

## üåü [Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite](https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)

The [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website) page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:

"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"

"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."

"[This is] bad design"

Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. In a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message round-trip from the application to the database server and back to the application. Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially, can be a serious performance drag. This is sometimes called the "N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.

SQLite is not client/server, however. The SQLite database runs in the same process address space as the application. Queries do not involve message round-trips, only a function call. The latency of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite. Hence, using a large number of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().

## [Faster JavaScript calls](https://v8.dev/blog/adaptor-frame)

JavaScript allows calling a function with a different number of arguments than the expected number of parameters, i.e., one can pass fewer or more arguments than the declared formal parameters. The former case is called under-application and the latter is called over-application.

In the under-application case, the remaining parameters get assigned the undefined value. In the over-application case, the remaining arguments can be accessed by using the rest parameter and the arguments property, or they are simply superfluous and they can be ignored. Many Web/Node.js frameworks nowadays use this JS feature to accept optional parameters and create a more flexible API.

Until recently, V8 had a special machinery to deal with arguments size mismatch: the arguments adaptor frame. Unfortunately, argument adaption comes at a performance cost, but is commonly needed in modern front-end and middleware frameworks. It turns out that, with a clever trick, we can remove this extra frame, simplify the V8 codebase and get rid of almost the entire overhead.
