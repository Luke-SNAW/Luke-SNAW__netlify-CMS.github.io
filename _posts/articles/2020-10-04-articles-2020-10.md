### 🌠 [Micro-frontends in context](https://increment.com/frontend/micro-frontends-in-context/)
When—and why—should developers consider this newer, smaller frontend architecture pattern?
#### Some aspects of micro-frontends

### 🌠 [ooooops I guess we’re* full-stack developers now](https://css-tricks.com/ooooops-i-guess-were-full-stack-developers-now/)

### LAMP
LAMP is Linux, Apache, MySQL,and PHP. It’s a rather old stack, but it’s still very huge. It’s what an awful lot of CMS’s run. LAMP is how the stack is talked about.\
If I’m a front-end developer working in that stack, I’m way over on the other side of the spectrum, not touching much of the technology the stack is referring to.

###  MEAN
MEAN is another stack, referring to MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. Notice the OS isn’t mentioned anymore.\
Notably, Angular is a front-end framework, so the stack is starting to include that. If I’m a front-end developer, what I’m working on overlaps with the stack.

### Serverless
Serverless moves the stack further to the right. We don’t even care what servers the code runs on anymore, it’s just server-side code using and creating APIs.\
If I’m a front-end developer working in this world, I overlap in that I might even be using my JavaScript abilities to be writing these serverless functions and digesting the APIs.

### STAR
Shawn Wang called Design Systems, TypeScript, Apollo GraphQL, and React a STAR app.\
That’s… like… all front end stuff.\
It seems to me the way we talk about the important technology that powers websites shifts more and more toward the front-end developer spectrum.

### 🌟 [useEffect](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1125041041063665666)
The question is not "when does this effect run" the question is "with which state does this effect synchronize with"
```
useEffect(fn) // all state
useEffect(fn, []) // no state
useEffect(fn, [these, states])
```

#### Why Paraphrase?
Paraphrasing is sharing your interpretation of what you’ve heard in your own words. \
It has the following benefits:

1. Paraphrasing encourages you to pay attention to what the speaker is saying because you’ll need to repeat it back to them.
2. Paraphrasing allows the speaker to correct your interpretation of what they said.
3. Paraphrasing allows the speaker to correct their own message after hearing it mirrored back to them.
4. Paraphrasing helps the speaker feel understood.
5. Paraphrasing saves time.
