### [25+ Interesting CSS Text Effects](https://1stwebdesigner.com/css-text-effects/)
### 🌠 [Micro-frontends in context](https://increment.com/frontend/micro-frontends-in-context/)

### 🌠 [ooooops I guess we’re* full-stack developers now](https://css-tricks.com/ooooops-i-guess-were-full-stack-developers-now/)

### LAMP
LAMP is Linux, Apache, MySQL,and PHP. It’s a rather old stack, but it’s still very huge. It’s what an awful lot of CMS’s run. LAMP is how the stack is talked about.\
If I’m a front-end developer working in that stack, I’m way over on the other side of the spectrum, not touching much of the technology the stack is referring to.

###  MEAN
MEAN is another stack, referring to MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. Notice the OS isn’t mentioned anymore.\
Notably, Angular is a front-end framework, so the stack is starting to include that. If I’m a front-end developer, what I’m working on overlaps with the stack.

### Serverless
Serverless moves the stack further to the right. We don’t even care what servers the code runs on anymore, it’s just server-side code using and creating APIs.\
If I’m a front-end developer working in this world, I overlap in that I might even be using my JavaScript abilities to be writing these serverless functions and digesting the APIs.

### STAR
Shawn Wang called Design Systems, TypeScript, Apollo GraphQL, and React a STAR app.\
That’s… like… all front end stuff.\
It seems to me the way we talk about the important technology that powers websites shifts more and more toward the front-end developer spectrum.

### 🌟 [useEffect](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1125041041063665666)
The question is not "when does this effect run" the question is "with which state does this effect synchronize with"
```
useEffect(fn) // all state
useEffect(fn, []) // no state
useEffect(fn, [these, states])
```
