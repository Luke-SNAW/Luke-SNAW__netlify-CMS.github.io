## [Using React-Native-KeyChain to Secure Mobile App Credentials](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-keychain-in-react-native-and-keeping-the-app-session-alive-ff8f8850119c)

- iOS Keychain service
- Android Secure Shared Preferences
  To use these two services, either you can write a bridge by yourself or more quickly you can use libraries. There are three standard libraries developers use, which are `react-native-keychain`, `react-native-secure-storage`, and `react-native-sensitive-info`.

The statistical analysis for downloads for three packages within one year shows that `react-native-keychain` is the most downloaded library that wraps up what you need.
