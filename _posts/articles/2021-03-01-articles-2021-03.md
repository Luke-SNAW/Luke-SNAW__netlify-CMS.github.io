## [The Web’s Missing Interoperability](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-webs-missing-interoperability/)

It was 2004, and Tim O’Reilly needed a name for his new conference, and so “Web 2.0” was hatched in a brainstorming session devoted to finding a name. A year later O’Reilly would flesh the concept out with his definitive 2005 post What is Web 2.0, but given the fact so many Web 2.0 applications were about creating platforms that were then made valuable with user-generated content, it feels appropriate that O’Reilly made a name first and added the content to justify it later.

## 🌟 [Variants – a quick tip for better React components](https://swizec.com/blog/variants-a-quick-tip-for-better-react-components)

Here's what you do 👉 turn those flags into a variant prop. Use TypeScript and you even get autocomplete 😍

```javascript
const Header = (props: { variant: "homepage" | "funnel" }) => {
  let hideMenu, showClose, showSignup
  switch (variant) {
    case "homepage":
      showSignup = true
    case "funnel":
      hideMenu = true
      showClose = true
  }
  return (
    <Box>
      <Logo />
      {!hideMenu && <MenuItem />}
      {!hideMenu && <MenuItem />}
      {!showSignup && <UserMessages />}
      {!showSignup && <UserProfile />}
      {showSignup && <SignupButton />}
      {showClose && <CloseButton />}
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Now the rest of your team can use your header with ease: `<Header variant="..." />.` And thanks to TypeScript their IDE tells them what's available.

## 🌠 [The Complete Guide to useRef() and Refs in React](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useref-guide/)

... So, the 2 main differences between state and references:
1. Updating state does trigger component re-rendering while updating a reference doesn’t.
2. The state update is asynchronous (the state variable is updated after re-rendering), while the reference updates synchronously (the updated value is available right away)


... Additionally, if the component unmounts while the stopwatch being active, the cleanup function of useEffect() is going to stop the timer too. 

### Updating references restriction

The function scope of the functional component should either calculate the output, either invoke hooks.

That’s why updating a reference (as well as updating state) shouldn’t be performed inside the immediate scope of the component’s function.

The reference must be updated either inside a useEffect() callback or inside handlers (event handlers, timer handlers, etc).

```javascript
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ prop }) {
  const myRef = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    myRef.current++; // Good!
    setTimeout(() => {
      myRef.current++; // Good!    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  const handler = () => {
    myRef.current++; // Good!  };

  myRef.current++; // Bad!
  if (prop) {
    myRef.current++; // Bad!  }

  return <button onClick={handler}>My button</button>;
}
```

## ⭐️ [SEO for JavaScript-heavy websites](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-seo-6b69f673ef8b)

### Describe your page with unique titles and snippets

Unique, descriptive titles and helpful meta descriptions in the head section

### Use the History API instead of fragments

For single-page applications with client-side routing, use the History API to implement routing between different views of your web app instead of hash-based routing techniques.

### Use meaningful HTTP status codes

### Design for accessibility

Create pages for users, not just search engines.

Write Semantic HTML — Use headings, sections, and paragraphs. HTML image and video tags with captions and alt text to add visuals.

### Implement Dynamic Rendering

It means switching between client-side rendered and pre-rendered content for specific user agents.

Some common dynamic renderers are Puppeteer, Rendertron, and prerender.io

### Implement Canonical tags

## 🌠 [A Helpful Algorithm to Determine "this" value in JavaScript](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-this-algorithm/)

### The terms used in the algorithm
The algorithm uses plenty of JavaScript terms. If you aren’t familiar with something, expand and look at the explanation.

#### Arrow function

An arrow function is a function defined using the fat arrow syntax =>. Example of an arrow function:
```javascript
const sum = (number1, number2) => {
  return number1 + number2;
}
```

#### Bound function

A bound function is a function created from invoking the method myFunc.bind(thisArg, arg1, ..., argN) upon a function. Example of a bound function:

```javascript
function originalFunction() {
  // ...
}
const boundFunction = originalFunction.bind({ prop: 'Value' });
```

#### Regular function
A regular function is a simple JavaScript function defined using function keyword or using a shorthand definition on an object. Examples of regular functions:
```javascript
function regularFunction(who) {
  return `Hello, ${who}!`;
}

const object = {
  anotherRegularFunction(who) {
    return `Good bye, ${who}!`
  }
};
```
#### constructor()
constructor() is a special method inside of a class that initializes the class instance.
```javascript
class SomeClass() {
  constructor(prop) {
    this.prop = prop;
  }
}
```
#### Outermost scope
The outermost scope is the top scope that doesn’t have an outer scope.
```javascript
// The outermost scope
let a = 1;

function someFunction() {
  // someFunction() scope
  // Not the outermost scope
  let b = 1;
}
```
#### Outer function
The outer function contains another function within its scope.
```javascript
// outerFunction() is the outer function of myFunction()
function outerFunction() {

  function myFunction() {

  }
}
```
#### Global object
The global object is the object that always exists in the global scope. window is the global object in a browser environment, global in Node environment.

#### Invocation
Invocation of a function is just calling the function with some arguments.
```javascript
function sum(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}
sum(1, 3);           // Invocation
sum.call({}, 3, 4);  // Invocation
sum.apply({}, 5, 9); // Invocation

const obj = {
  method() {
    return 'Some method';
  }
};
obj.method(); // Invocation

class SomeClass {
  constructor(prop) {
    this.prop = prop;
  } 
}
const instance = new SomeClass('Value'); // Invocation
```

####Constructor invocation
Constructor invocation happens when a function or class is invoked using new keyword.
```javascript
function MyCat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const fluffy = new MyCat('Fluffy'); // Constructor invocation

class MyDog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
const rex = new MyDog('Rex'); // Constructor invocation
```

#### Indirect invocation
An indirect invocation of happens when a function is called using func.call(thisArg, ...) or func.apply(thisArg, ...) methods.
```javascript
function sum(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

sum.call({}, 1, 2);  // Indirect invocation
sum.apply({}, 3, 5); // Indirect invocation
```

#### Method invocation
Method invocation happens when a function is invoked in a property accessor expression object.method().
```javascript
const object = {
  greeting(who) {
    return `Hello, ${who}!`
  }
};

object.greeting('World');    // Method invocation
object['greeting']('World'); // Method invocation
```

#### Regular invocation
Regular invocation happens when the sole variable containing the function is used for invocation func(...).
```javascript
function sum(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

sum(1, 4); // Regular invocation
```

#### Strict mode
Strict mode is a special mode imposed upon running JavaScript code having some special restrictions. The strict mode is enabled by adding 'use strict' directive at the start of the script or the top of the function scope.

## 🌠 [Before You memo()](https://overreacted.io/before-you-memo/)

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  let [color, setColor] = useState('red');
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={color} onChange={(e) => setColor(e.target.value)} />
      <p style={{ color }}>Hello, world!</p>
      <ExpensiveTree />
    </div>
  );
}

function ExpensiveTree() {
  let now = performance.now();
  while (performance.now() - now < 100) {
    // Artificial delay -- do nothing for 100ms
  }
  return <p>I am a very slow component tree.</p>;
}
```

### Solution 1: Move State Down

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Form />
      <ExpensiveTree />
    </>
  );
}

function Form() {
  let [color, setColor] = useState('red');
  return (
    <>
      <input value={color} onChange={(e) => setColor(e.target.value)} />
      <p style={{ color }}>Hello, world!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Solution 2: Lift Content Up

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ColorPicker>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <ExpensiveTree />
    </ColorPicker>
  );
}

  let [color, setColor] = useState("red");
  return (
    <div style={{ color }}>
      <input value={color} onChange={(e) => setColor(e.target.value)} />
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

## ⭐️ [When Should I Interrupt Someone?](https://zwischenzugs.com/2021/03/15/when-should-i-interrupt-someone/)

### The Rule of Thumb

> If you’re stuck for over an hour, seek help.

A further piece of advice which I add to this is:

> When you seek advice, first write down everything you’ve tried.

This has at least three benefits:

1. It acts as a form of [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Very often, in the process of taking a step back and writing down what you’ve tried, you’ll see what you missed.
2. When you go to get help, you have evidence that you’ve gone through some kind of structured thought process before raising the alarm, rather than just asking for help as soon as the going got tough.
3. You will save time explaining the context to someone else you’ve forced to context switch.

An essay is not required. Just enough notes to explain clearly and concisely what problem you’re facing and what your thinking was about how to solve it.

## ⭐️ [The #1 tip to familiarize with new JavaScript Codebases](https://www.kevinpeters.net/the-fastest-way-to-understand-new-code-bases)

My technique to check the files in detail is quite simple. I first look over the file and check what the exported functions are called. Ideally, I write them down. Internal functions are firstly not important to understand. Once I have an overview of all the exported functions I foremost check if there are any unit tests.

Unit tests are a good first approach to see how the functions are working. To understand functions you probably just need to look at the input, the function name, and what it is returning.
