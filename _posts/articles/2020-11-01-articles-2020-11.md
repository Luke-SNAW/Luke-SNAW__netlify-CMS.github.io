```HTML
<div>
  Hi, my name is Maria.
  <script>
    alert(JSON.stringify(localstorage));
  </script>
</div>
```
This code would just alert the local storage content, but could as well send it to the attacker.\
This HTML and its embedded script are on Maria‚Äôs profile in Mr. Smith‚Äôs browser.\
And so can access Mr. Smith‚Äôs data in Mr. Smith‚Äôs local storage.

The Next.js React application framework provides developers with the SWR hook. The following code provides an example of usage:
```javascript
// Custom React hook using the useSWR hook to fetch remote data about a user 
function useUser (id) {
  const { data, error } = useSWR(`/api/user/${id}`, fetcher)
  return {
    user: data,
    isLoading: !error && !data,
    isError: error
  }
}

// page component
function Page() {
  return  <div>
    <Navbar  />
    <Content  />
  </div>
}

// child components
function Navbar () {
  return  <div>
    ...
    <Avatar  />
  </div>
}

function Content () {
  const  { user, isLoading }  =  useUser()
  if  (isLoading)  return  <Spinner  />
  return  <h1>Welcome back,  {user.name}</h1>
}

function Avatar () {
  const  { user, isLoading }  =  useUser()
  if  (isLoading)  return  <Spinner  />
  return  <img  src={user.avatar}  alt={user.name} />
}
```

And here's some evidence to support these calculations:
- 96px
- 101.6q
- 25.4mm
- 2.54cm
- 1in

Keep in mind that while such measurements are possible, it's not recommended to use them (unless you're making a virtual ruler or something like that üòÖ)

## üåü [Inspecting a Vue application in production](https://www.damianmullins.com/inspecting-a-vue-application-in-production/)
To start we need to locate the top-level element of the component using the Chrome devtools elements panel. In this case, the element is the h1.

### Using the $0 command
Once you have the element selected you can then move to the console panel in devtools and type $0.

$0 will be a reference to the most recently selected element in the element panel.

> If you highlight another element you can still reference the last one by typing $1, this will work for the last 5 elements highlighted.

To see the Vue instance details you can type `$0.__vue__`.

### Using the document.querySelector method
You can also select the element using any of the DOM lookup methods such as querySelector or getElementById etc. In this case, we‚Äôll use document.querySelector to see the Vue instance:
```javascript
document.querySelector('[data-v-763db97b]').__vue__
```
## üå† [What is Metaprogramming in JavaScript? In English, please.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-metaprogramming-in-javascript-in-english-please/)
> `Metaprogramming` is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. This means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze, or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

Simply put, Metaprogramming involves writing code that can

- Generate code
- Manipulate language constructs at the run time. This phenomenon is known as `Reflective Metaprogramming` or `Reflection`.

### What is Reflection in Metaprogramming?
Reflection is a branch of Metaprogramming. Reflection has three sub-branches:

- Introspection: Code is able to inspect itself. It is used to discover very low-level information about the code. (Reflect API)
- Self-Modification: As the name suggests, code is able to modify itself.
- Intercession: Acting on behalf of somebody else. This can be achieved by wrapping, trapping, intercepting. (Proxy Object)

### In Summary
To summarize,

- Reflect and Proxy are great inclusions in JavaScript to help with Metaprogramming.
- Lots of complex situations can be handled with their help.
- Be aware of the downsides as well.
- ES6 Symbols also can be used with your existing classes and objects to change their behavior.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è [React Forms Tutorial: How to Access Input Values, Validate, and Submit Forms](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-forms-tutorial/)
By default, when clicking the form‚Äôs Submit button, the browser performs a full-page POST request to the URL specified in the action attribute of the `<form>`. But having the form controlled by React, you can prevent browser‚Äôs default behavior by attaching an event handler to onSubmit event and calling event.preventDefault().

Also, inside the same onSubmit event handler you can access the form data from the corresponding state variable, and save it manually using your preferred way: by making an async fetch POST request.

## ‚≠ê [React useRef can be used for more than you thinkÔ∏è](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-useref-can-be-used-for-more-than-you-think-d4cfe7d90797)
### Example 1
We store the timer in an instance variable. We could also have stored the timer in the state but it would cause an extra render. We don‚Äôt want that.
### Example 2
Consider a scenario where you need to execute some side effects on a component, but not after the initial render.
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
   // do something
  })
```
which will execute on every render, won‚Äôt work (because the effect will be executed even after the initial render).
So, once again, useRef to the rescue!
We could do something like this,
```javascript
const hasMounted= useRef(false)
useEffect(() => {
    if (hasMounted.current) {
      // do something
    } else hasMounted.current = true
  }
```

```javascript

  .then(
    // The promise is fulfilled with the response object.
    function(response) {
      // If the response was not successful,
      // stop the chain by throwing an error.
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(
          `${response.status} ${response.statusText}`
        );
      }
      // Otherwise parse the response body as JSON.
      // This returns a new Promise.
      return response.json();
    }
  )
  // Continue with the Promise returned by response.json().
  .then(
    function(data) {
      // data is now a JavaScript object.
      // Do something with it.
      console.log('Success!', data);
    }
  )
  // Handle all potential errors that happened above.
  // Only pass an error handler, no success handler.
  // This is equivalent to .catch(function(‚Ä¶) {‚Ä¶}).
  .then(
    null,
    function(error) {
      console.error('Error!', error);
      // Report the error to a logging service,
      // activate a fallback or send the request again.
    }
  );

Use the ‚Äúhamburger method‚Äù
Try beginning with a positive, constructive comment on something that works well in the design that is being critiqued. Next, get to the meat, which is, of course, the constructive criticism‚Äîwhat could be improved. Finally, end with another positive acknowledgement.

Many ‚Äúold-school‚Äù faculty members dismiss this method as superficial candy-coating‚Äîknown more colloquially as the ‚Äúshit sandwich.‚Äù But candy-coating isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. It makes it possible for students to absorb negative feedback. As long as the hamburger‚Äôs ‚Äúbuns‚Äù are comprised of genuine, accurate observations, students benefit from receiving feedback that addresses both what is and isn‚Äôt working in their designs.
