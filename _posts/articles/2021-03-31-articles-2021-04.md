## [[프로젝트] KPT 방법론으로 삼성전자 C-Lab M 프로젝트 회고하기](https://blog.handstudio.net/1585)

> 핸드에서는 프로젝트에 참여한 팀원들이 미리 프로젝트 진행 과정과 이슈에 대해서 생각해보고, 회고 시간에 논의를 풍성하게 하기 위해 KEEP/ PROBLEM/ TRY 항목별로 구글 설문지를 만들어 활용하고 있습니다. 회고는 회의 전에 미리 받은 설문 내용을 PM이 취합해 내용을 가감없이 공유한 뒤, 회고 회의 시간에 모여 답변을 바탕으로 자유롭게 의견을 나누는 방식으로 진행합니다. 미리 팀원들의 의견을 검토한 후에 회고 회의에 참석할 수 있기 때문에, 충분한 논의가 가능하며 시간도 절약해줍니다.

> 문항이 너무 많거나 중복된다면 설문 참여 자체가 피로해질 수 있기 때문에, 프로젝트를 돌아볼 수 있을 정도의 문항으로 추려서 진행해보았습니다. 아래는 M프로젝트의 회고를 위해 KPT 방법론을 기반으로 작성한 회고 설문지 내용입니다.

### Keep

1. 프로젝트를 진행하며 만족스러웠던, 성취감을 느꼈던 부분은 어떤 것이었나요?
2. 다른 프로젝트를 진행하면서도 유지하면 좋을 것이라고 생각되는 접근 방식 / 업무 수행 방식 / 태도 등이 있을까요?

### Problem

1. 어떤 과정/ 순간이 특별히 어렵거나 힘들다고 느꼈나요?
2. 위에서 답변한 고충이 있었다면, 불가피한 고충이었다고 생각하나요?
3. 이 외에도 프로젝트를 하며 마주친 문제들 중, 꼭 해결됐으면 좋겠다고 생각하는 문제가 있을까요?

### Try

1. 팀원과 협력하면서 배운 점은 어떤 것이 있었나요?
2. 새로운 클라이언트와 협력하면서 배운 점은 어떤 것이 있었나요?
3. 앞서 Problem으로 정의한 부분을 해결하기 위한 시도가 있을까요? Problem으로 정의하진 않았지만, 다음에 시도해 볼 만한 방법이나 접근이 있나요?

### Others

1. 이 프로젝트는 나에게 몇 점짜리 프로젝트였나요?
2. 위 점수를 준 이유를 간단히 적어주세요.

### 주요 사건을 5F로 공유하기

- 사실(fact)
- 느낌(Feeling)
- 교훈(finding)
- 향후 행동(Future action)
- 피드백(Feedback)

즉, 프로젝트를 진행하면서 있었던 주요 사건들을 시간축으로 정렬해서 5가지 F로 나누어 돌아보는 방법이다.

## [Where do you find potential customers to validate your idea / MVP?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26644616)

- Go through your linkedin/twitter/instagram account. Find people who would be interested. Send them an email/message. 
- Search online for thought leaders, industry people that work in that specific field. Could be as easy as a twitter search, it could be more complex like going through white papers and emailing researchers. 
- There are websites where you can request all sorts of feed back including MVP feedback. Fiver has a section (https://www.fiverr.com/categories/programming-tech/user-testing-services), and there are niche sites https://www.usertesting.com/
- Hacker News?
- Reddit has subs dedicated to that sort of thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/websitefeedback/
- Meetups. 2 different versions. 1) Prepare your elevator pitch and bring your phone 2) Message meetup founders and ask them where they would go for feedback, since they are thought leaders of sorts.
- Dischord (mentioned elsewhere) 
- Just start trying to sell it the way that you planned on marketing it (hopefully you've thought about your marketing plan)

## [5 tips for a healthier DivOps setup](https://www.benmvp.com/blog/5-tips-healthier-divops-setup/)

DivOps, probably more commonly known as Frontend Infrastructure, is all of the tooling needed to set up, maintain, and deploy a modern frontend application. So we’re talking Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, Prettier, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, Cypress, and many many more. They, in addition to the actual code, are what make up our frontend apps.

## 🌟 [Replacing let with const. Even when it feels impossible](https://charles-stover.medium.com/replacing-let-with-const-86797b790775)

```javascript
let height = 60;
if (name === 'Charles') {
  height = 70;
} else if (
  gender === Gender.Male &&
  race === Race.White
) {
  height = 69;
} else if (gender === Gender.Female) {
  height = 64;
}
```
In the above example, I have conditionally defined the height variable. It starts as let so that I may reassign it immediately to what I want it to constantly be. It’s value will be unchanging going forward, and I really wish I were able to define it as a constant to represent how I do not want future code to ever change it.

There is always more than one way to solve a problem. In this case, you could use a really long ternary to define height as a const, but in some cases that might not be the best (or possible) solution. I want to propose a solution that is applicable to all uses of let, not just this one.

This solution may not be the most optimal for every use case, but it is applicable to every use case, and it is extensible to any refactor. If you ever find yourself using let, you can use this pattern to replace your let with const.

The answer is functions.

```javascript
function getHeight({ gender, name, race }) {
  if (name === 'Charles') {
    return 70;
  }
  if (
    gender === Gender.Male &&
    race === Race.White
  ) {
    return 69;
  }
  if (gender === Gender.Female) {
    return 64;
  }
  return 60;
}
const height = getHeight({ gender, name, race });
```

In this example, each conditional assignment (name === 'Value') is replaced with a return statement. The use of return statements allows multiple to exist in one function scope, without the use of temporary variables (let).

I use this pattern all the time, and I love it.

Is the code longer? Yes. Is it more readable? Yes. It is more maintainable? Yes. Is it less subject to user error? Yes. Is it easier to unit test? Yes.
```javascript
expect(getHeight({ name: 'Charles' })).toBe(70);
expect(getHeight({
  gender: Gender.Male,
  race: Race.White,
})).toBe(69);
expect(getHeight({ gender: Gender.Female })).toBe(64);
expect(getHeight({ gender: Gender.Male })).toBe(60);
```

## [HTML defines a ping attribute on anchor elements (links)](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/html-defines-a-ping-attribute-on-anchor-elements-links/)

The anchor element's ping attribute accepts a space-separated list of URLs. When an anchor defines ping URLs and someone clicks it, the browser sends a POST request to these specified URLs. This functionality can be helpful if you want to track and analyse how users interact with your site.

```HTML
<a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/popular-posts/" 
   ping="https://www.stefanjudis.com/tracking/">Read popular posts</a>
