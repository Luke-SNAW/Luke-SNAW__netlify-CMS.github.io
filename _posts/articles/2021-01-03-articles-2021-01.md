## [URL shorteners set ad tracking cookies](https://ylukem.com/blog/url-shorteners-set-ad-tracking-cookies)
This isn’t a phenomenon limited to TinyURL. More common URL shorteners like t.co (Twitter) and bit.ly set cookies when you click on a link. While neither redirect you to an advertising company like TinyURL, Twitter’s primary business model is advertising, and bit.ly’s privacy policy says they share data with third parties to “…provide advertising products and services…”

Don’t use URL shorteners. And if you click on a link from a URL shortener, I recommend using tools like the [Temporary Containers Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/) to limit the scope of ad tracking.
