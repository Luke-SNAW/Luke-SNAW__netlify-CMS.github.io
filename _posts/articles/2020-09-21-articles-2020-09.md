## [Using ES Modules with Dynamic Imports to Implement Microfrontends](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-es-modules-with-dynamic-imports-to-implement-micro-frontends-7c840a38890e)
three fundamentally different ways of implementing microfrontends:
- **Compile-time rendered** — a central CI/CD pipeline builds a monolith when any of its independent components update.
For example, using Bit, components are built independently — then, published (from different repos) to a “collection” on Bit.dev. These published components will then be imported and integrated into a single app. Whenever a component gets modified and “pushed” with a bumped version, it triggers the CI/CD of the project that is composing everything.
- **Server-side rendered** (i.e., a view is composed from different parts upon request, potentially also cache-able)
- **Runtime rendered** (i.e., the page is constructed in the browser, the different parts may be combined dynamically)
## [How Micro Frontends are being Implemented in 2020: A Survey](https://blog.bitsrc.io/microfrontends-survey-evaluation-d2af7eade306)
![List of Known Frameworks](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VJqtsW-jS_RjlSb9tO4c_g.png)

Asking the participants about other frameworks or techniques they use we get:
- Pure distribution standards and technologies such as **AMD**, **SystemJS**, or **iframe**.
- Architecture decisions such as **vertical/horizontal split**, **client/edge-side**, **server-side composition**.
- Tooling based solutions, e.g., **Webpack Module Federation**, **React + Webpack - React Suspense + Dynamic Module Loading + Lerna + Yarn Workspaces**.
- Other frameworks/solutions such as **UmiJS**, **icestark**, or **feature-hub.io**.

![Most Seen Advantages of Microfrontends](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sPuJwr55s5J7u0HldpyIlw.png)

### Reasons for Not Using Microfrontends
1. Complexity (tooling, versioning, UX alignment, …)
2. Performance (bundle size, loading time, …)
3. Multi-framework (knowledge, overhead, …)
4. Lack of standards (foundation, CSS isolation, …)
5. Testing
6. Architecture

One reason why people don’t like the currently available solutions is that
> Most frameworks and UI libraries assume they’re you’re only choice and don’t integrate well.

This is certainly right. However, in my opinion this is just the reflection that these frameworks definitely serve different purposes and solve different problems.

## [New COOP and COEP Cross-Origin Policies for Increased Security in Chrome and Firefox](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/coop-coep-cross-origin-isolation/)

Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks like Spectre. To mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolated. With a cross-origin isolated state, the webpage will be able to use privileged features including:

- SharedArrayBuffer (required for WebAssembly Threads)
- performance.measureMemory()
- JS Self-Profiling API
