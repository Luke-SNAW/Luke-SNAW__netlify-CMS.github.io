## [Using ES Modules with Dynamic Imports to Implement Microfrontends](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-es-modules-with-dynamic-imports-to-implement-micro-frontends-7c840a38890e)
three fundamentally different ways of implementing microfrontends:
- **Compile-time rendered** — a central CI/CD pipeline builds a monolith when any of its independent components update.
For example, using Bit, components are built independently — then, published (from different repos) to a “collection” on Bit.dev. These published components will then be imported and integrated into a single app. Whenever a component gets modified and “pushed” with a bumped version, it triggers the CI/CD of the project that is composing everything.
- **Server-side rendered** (i.e., a view is composed from different parts upon request, potentially also cache-able)
- **Runtime rendered** (i.e., the page is constructed in the browser, the different parts may be combined dynamically)
## [How Micro Frontends are being Implemented in 2020: A Survey](https://blog.bitsrc.io/microfrontends-survey-evaluation-d2af7eade306)
![List of Known Frameworks](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VJqtsW-jS_RjlSb9tO4c_g.png)

Asking the participants about other frameworks or techniques they use we get:
- Pure distribution standards and technologies such as **AMD**, **SystemJS**, or **iframe**.
- Architecture decisions such as **vertical/horizontal split**, **client/edge-side**, **server-side composition**.
- Tooling based solutions, e.g., **Webpack Module Federation**, **React + Webpack - React Suspense + Dynamic Module Loading + Lerna + Yarn Workspaces**.
- Other frameworks/solutions such as **UmiJS**, **icestark**, or **feature-hub.io**.

![Most Seen Advantages of Microfrontends](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sPuJwr55s5J7u0HldpyIlw.png)

### Reasons for Not Using Microfrontends
1. Complexity (tooling, versioning, UX alignment, …)
2. Performance (bundle size, loading time, …)
3. Multi-framework (knowledge, overhead, …)
4. Lack of standards (foundation, CSS isolation, …)
5. Testing
6. Architecture

One reason why people don’t like the currently available solutions is that
> Most frameworks and UI libraries assume they’re you’re only choice and don’t integrate well.

This is certainly right. However, in my opinion this is just the reflection that these frameworks definitely serve different purposes and solve different problems.

## [New COOP and COEP Cross-Origin Policies for Increased Security in Chrome and Firefox](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/coop-coep-cross-origin-isolation/)

Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks like Spectre. To mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolated. With a cross-origin isolated state, the webpage will be able to use privileged features including:

- SharedArrayBuffer (required for WebAssembly Threads)
- performance.measureMemory()
- JS Self-Profiling API

## [Cookie Recipes - SameSite and beyond](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/cookie-recipes-web-dev-live/?utm_source=notification_email&utm_campaign=notifications&utm_medium=link&utm_content=content_in_followed_topic&utm_term=daily)
```
Set-Cookie:
  __Host-cookiename=cookievalue;
  Secure;
  Path=/;
  HttpOnly;
  SameSite=Lax
```
### Secure attribute
meant to keep cookie communication limited to encrypted transmission, ensuring that browsers use cookies only via secure/encrypted HTTPS connections.

### Path=\
The cookie path configuration (Path=\ ) means that the cookie is sent for all requests to the current document origin (e.g., example.com) — not including the subdomains for that origin (e.g., images.example.com).

### HttpOnly attribute
ensures that cookies will only be sent in request headers, and will not be accessible via client-side scripting (e.g. JavaScript) and therefore cannot be stolen easily via cross-site scripting (a pervasive attack technique).

### SameSite attribute
can take any of three values: Strict, Lax and None, and regulates the browser behavior in presence of same-site cookies. With theStrict configuration, browsers should only send these cookies with requests originated from the same domain/site as the target domain. This would effectively mitigate cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks, the latter which exploits the trust that a site has in a user’s browser.
> Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks rely on the fact that cookies are attached to any request to a given origin, no matter who initiates the request. For example, if you visit evil.example then it can trigger requests to your-blog.example, and your browser will happily attach the associated cookies. If your blog isn’t careful with how it validates those requests then evil.example could trigger actions like deleting posts or adding their own content.

With a Strict configuration, cookies will thus only be sent in a first-party context. This is good when cookies relate to functionality that will always be behind an initial navigation, such as changing a password or making a purchase. There are however first-party use cases for which this behavior is too restrictive. For those cases, the Lax value may be a better fit: cookies are [withheld on cross-site sub-requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Attributes), such as calls to load images or frames, but sent when a user navigates to the URL from an external site, such as by following a link.

Sites will have to ensure that cookies that are needed in a third-party context are marked as SameSite=None; Secure (i.e. both attributes together). Merewood explained Chrome’s behavior in a [related blog article](https://web.dev/samesite-cookie-recipes/):
> If you just specify None without Secure the cookie will be rejected. There are some mutually incompatible differences in browser implementations though, so you may need to use […] mitigating strategies.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UPY82Qy.png)

As of July 2020, Safari, Firefox, and Brave blocked all third-party cookies by default. Safari allows embedded sites to use the Storage Access API to request permission to set first-party cookies. Chrome plans to start blocking third-party cookies by 2022.

## [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate)
JavaScript and TypeScript finite state machines and statecharts for the modern web.

### [Leveraging Declarative Programming to Create Maintainable Web Apps](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/declarative-development-fsm-programming)
#### 1-1 Mapping of State Machines to Stateful UI Components
Take, for example, a much simplified, fictional eCommerce site that has the following React views:

```
<App>
  <SigninForm />
  <RegistrationForm />
  <Products />
  <Cart />
  <Admin>
    <Users />
    <Products />
  </Admin>
</App>
```
The process for generating state machines corresponding to the above views may be familiar for those who have used the Redux state management library:

1. **Does the component have state that needs to be modeled?** For example, Admin/Products may not; paged fetches to the server plus a caching solution (such as SWR) may suffice. On the other hand, components such as SignInForm or the Cart usually contain state that needs to be managed, such as data entered into fields or the current cart contents.
2. **Are local state techniques (e.g., React’s setState() / useState()) sufficient to capture the problem?** Tracking whether the cart popup modal is currently open hardly requires the use of a finite-state machine.
3. **Is the resulting state machine likely to be too complex?** If so, split the machine into several smaller ones, identifying opportunities to create child machines that can be reused elsewhere. For example, the SignInForm and RegistrationForm machines may invoke instances of a child textFieldMachine to model validation and state for user email, name, and password fields.

#### When to Use a Finite-state Machine Model
While statecharts and FSMs can elegantly solve some challenging problems, deciding the best tools and approaches to use for a particular application usually depends on several factors.

Some situations where using finite-state machines shine:

- **Your application includes a considerable data entry component** where field accessibility or visibility is governed by complex rules: for example, form entry in an insurance claims app. Here, FSMs help ensure business rules are implemented robustly. Further, the visualization features of statecharts can be used to help increase collaboration with non-technical stakeholders and identify detailed business requirements early on in development.
- **To work better on slower connections and deliver higher-fidelity experiences to users**, web apps must manage increasingly complex async data flows. FSMs explicitly model all states an application can be in, and statecharts can be visualized to help diagnose and solve asynchronous data problems.
- **Applications that require a lot of sophisticated, state-based animation.** For complex animations, techniques for modeling animations as event streams through time with RxJS are popular. For many scenarios, this works well, however, when rich animation is combined with a complex series of known states, FSMs provide well-defined “rest points” that the animations flow between. FSMs combined with RxJS seem the perfect combination to help deliver the next wave of high-fidelity, expressive user experiences.
- **Rich client applications** such as photo or video editing, diagram-creation tools, or games where much of the business logic resides client side. FSMs are inherently decoupled from the UI framework or libraries and are easy to write tests for allowing high-quality applications to be iterated on quickly and shipped with confidence.

#### Finite-state Machine Caveats
- The general approach, best practices, and API for statechart libraries such as XState are novel to most front-end developers, who will require investment of time and resources in order to become productive, particularly for less experienced teams.
- Similar to the previous caveat, while XState’s popularity continues to grow and is well documented, existing state management libraries such as Redux, MobX, or React Context have huge followings that provide a wealth of online information XState doesn’t yet match.
- For applications following a simpler CRUD model, existing state management techniques combined with a good resource caching library such as SWR or React Query will suffice. Here, the extra constraints FSMs provide, while incredibly helpful in complex apps, may slow development down.
- The tooling is less mature than other state management libraries, with work still underway on improved TypeScript support and browser devtools extensions.
